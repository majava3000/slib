slib (silly lib)
================

This project is all about poking SoCs without a vendor SDK.

A blog article relating to the project will be released in a few days ( https://lowerstrata.net )

NOTE: The code is horrific! It certainly does not demonstrate best conventions.
      The humble objective is to progressively make it better by introducing
      new concepts.

Current execution environment is FRDM-K64F, and you'll probably want to run
your make on an UNIXy system with gcc/binutils suitable for bare metal ARM
Cortex work installed.
